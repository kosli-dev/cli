          # In our case, cli reference md files, and docs.kosli.com/assets/metadata.json
          # are not part of the repository - they get generated only in release workflow. 
          # When they get generated they are also copied to docs-main branch, and we don't need to preserve 
          # anything from previous version of docs-main branch - hence no CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE in release.yml.
          #
          # When we release just static content, the cli reference md files, and 
          # docs.kosli.com/assets/metadata.json are not present, but we use CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE to preserve
          # their versions pushed to docs-main during last release - hence CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE in
          # publish_docs.yml, to prevent removing them before copying
