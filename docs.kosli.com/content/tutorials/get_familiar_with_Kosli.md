# Get familiar with Kosli

> The following guide is the easiest and quickest way to try Kosli out and understand its features. 
It is made to run from your local machine, but the same concepts and steps apply to using Kosli in a production setup.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how Kosli allows you to follow a source code change to runtime environments.
You'll set up a `docker` environment, use Kosli to record build and deployment events, and track what 
artifacts are running in your runtime environment. 

This tutorial uses the `docker` Kosli environment type, but the same steps can be applied to 
other supported environment types.

{{< hint info >}}
As you go through the guide you can also check your progress from 
[your browser](https://app.kosli.com).

In the upper left corner there is a house icon. Next to it you can select
which organization you want to view. Your personal organization
has the same name as your github login name, and is the organization you will
be using in this guide.
{{< /hint >}}

## Step 1: Prerequisites and Kosli account

To follow the tutorial, you will need to:

- Install `Docker`.
- [Create a Kosli account](https://app.kosli.com/sign-up) if you have not got one already.
- [Install Kosli CLI](/getting_started/install/).
- [Get a Kosli API token](/getting_started/service-accounts/).
- Set the `KOSLI_ORG` and `KOSLI_API_TOKEN` environment variables:
  ```shell {.command}
  export KOSLI_ORG=<your-org>
  export KOSLI_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
  ```
- You can check your Kosli set up by running: 
    ```shell {.command}
    kosli list flows
    ```
    which should return a list of flows or the message "No flows were found".

- Clone our quickstart-docker repository:
    ```shell {.command}
    git clone https://github.com/kosli-dev/quickstart-docker-example.git
    cd quickstart-docker-example
    ```

## Step 2: Create a Kosli Flow

<!--
For this tutorial we are using the first kind:
- the *Flow* corresponds to the git repository
- the Artifact being built and deployed is an `nginx` docker image
When attesting evidence, the target of the attestation must be named.
These names are defined in a yml file.
-->

The Flow's yml template-file exists in the git repository.
Confirm this yml file exists by catting it:

```shell {.command}
cat kosli.yml
```

You will see the following output, specifying the existence of an Artifact named `nginx`:


```plaintext {.light-console}
version: 1

trail:
  artifacts:
    - name: nginx
```

Create a Kosli *Flow* called `quickstart-nginx` using this yml template-file:

```shell {.command}
kosli create flow2 quickstart-nginx \
    --description "Flow for quickstart nginx image" \
    --template-file kosli.yml
```

Confirm the Kosli Flow called `quickstart-nginx` was created:

```shell {.command}
kosli list flows
```

which will produce the following output:

```plaintext {.light-console}
NAME              DESCRIPTION                          VISIBILITY
quickstart-nginx  Flow for quickstart nginx image      private
```
{{< hint info >}}
In the web interface you can select *Flows* on the left.
It will show you that you have a *quickstart-nginx* Flow.
If you select the Flow it will show that no Artifacts have
been reported yet.
{{< /hint  >}}


## Step 3: Create a Kosli Trail

Create a Kosli *Trail*, in the `quickstart-nginx` Flow, whose 
name is the repository's current git-commit:

```shell {.command}
GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
kosli begin trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
    --flow quickstart-nginx
```

<!--
Step to confirm the Trail exists?
-->

## Step 4: Create a Kosli environment

<!--
A Kosli *Environment* stores snapshots containing information about
the software Artifacts you are running in your runtime environment.
Kosli supports many kinds of runtime environments; (server, Kubernetes cluster, AWS, etc.)  
-->

Create a Kosli *Environment* called `quickstart` whose type is `docker`:

```shell {.command}
kosli create environment quickstart \
    --type docker \
    --description "quickstart environment for tutorial"
```

You can verify that the Kosli *Environment* was created:

```shell {.command}
kosli list environments
```

```plaintext {.light-console}
NAME        TYPE    LAST REPORT  LAST MODIFIED
quickstart  docker               2022-11-01T15:30:56+01:00
```

{{< hint info >}}
If you refresh the *Environments* web page in your Kosli account, 
it will show you that you have a *quickstart* environment and that
no snapshot reports have been received yet.
{{< /hint >}}

## Step 5: Attest an Artifact to Kosli

Typically, you would build an Artifact in your CI system, in response to a git-commit.
The quickstart-docker repository contains a `docker-compose.yml` file which uses an [nginx](https://nginx.org/) 
docker image which you will be using as your Artifact in this tutorial instead.

Pull the docker image - the Kosli CLI needs the Artifact to be locally present to 
generate a "fingerprint" to identify it:

```shell {.command}
docker compose pull
```

You can check that this has worked by typing: 
```shell {.command}
docker images nginx
```
The output should look like this:
```plaintext {.light-console}
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
nginx        1.21      8f05d7383593   5 months ago   134MB
```

Now report the artifact to Kosli using the `kosli attest artifact` command.

Note:
- The `--name` flag has the value `nginx` which is the (only) artifact
name defined in the `kosli.yml` file from step 2.
- The `--build-url` and `--commit-url` flags have dummy values;
in a real call these would get default values (e.g. from Github Actions).

```shell {.command}
GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
kosli attest artifact nginx:1.21 \  
    --name nginx \
    --flow quickstart-nginx \
    --trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
    --artifact-type docker \
    --build-url https://example.com \
    --commit-url https://github.com/kosli-dev/quickstart-docker-example/commit/9f14efa0c91807da9a8b1d1d6332c5b3aa24a310 \
    --git-commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)    
```

<!--
It is noticeable here that we are providing the git-commit twice;
once for the name of the trail, and once for the actual git-commit.
It is also noticeable that the git-commit is hard-wired to 9f14efa...
in several places, and it will be incorrect whenever the repo gets new git
commit (eg to add the kosli.yml file)
-->

You can verify that you have reported the Artifact in your *quickstart-nginx* flow:

```shell {.command}
kosli list artifacts --flow quickstart-nginx
```

```plaintext {.light-console}
COMMIT   ARTIFACT                                                                       STATE      CREATED_AT
9f14efa  Name: nginx:1.21                                                               COMPLIANT  Tue, 01 Nov 2022 15:46:59 CET
         Fingerprint: 2bcabc23b45489fb0885d69a06ba1d648aeda973fae7bb981bafbb884165e514                 
```

## Step 6: Report what is running in your environment

First, run the artifact:
```shell {.command}
docker compose up -d
```

Confirm the container is running:

```shell {.command}
docker ps
```
The output should include an entry similar to this:

```plaintext {.light-console}
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE      COMMAND                 CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                  NAMES
6330e545b532  nginx:1.21 "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"  35 seconds ago  Up 34 seconds  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   quickstart-nginx
```

Report all the docker containers running on your machine to Kosli:

```shell {.command}
kosli snapshot docker quickstart
```

You can confirm this has created an environment snapshot:

```shell {.command}
kosli list snapshots quickstart
```
```plaintext {.light-console}
SNAPSHOT  FROM                           TO   DURATION
1         Tue, 01 Nov 2022 15:55:49 CET  now  11 seconds
```

You can get a detailed view of all the docker containers included in the snapshot report:

```shell {.command}
kosli get snapshot quickstart
```

```plaintext {.light-console}
COMMIT  ARTIFACT                                                                       FLOW  RUNNING_SINCE  REPLICAS
N/A     Name: nginx:1.21                                                               N/A   3 minutes ago  1
        Fingerprint: 8f05d73835934b8220e1abd2f157ea4e2260b9c26f6f63a8e3975e7affa46724
```

The `kosli snapshot docker` command reports *all* the 
docker containers running in your environment, equivalent to the output from 
`docker ps`. This tutorial only shows the `nginx` container 
in the examples.

{{< hint info >}}
If you refresh the *Environments* web page in your Kosli account, you will see 
that there is now a timestamp for *Last Change At* column. 
Select the *quickstart* link on left for a detailed view of what is currently running.
{{< /hint >}}

## Step 7: Searching Kosli

Now that you have reported your Artifact and what's running in your runtime environment,
you can use the `kosli search` command to find everything Kosli knows about an Artifact or a git-commit.

For example, you can give Kosli search the git-commit whose CI run built and deployed the Artifact: 

```shell {.command}
kosli search 9f14efa
```

```plaintext {.light-console}
Search result resolved to commit 9f14efa0c91807da9a8b1d1d6332c5b3aa24a310
Name:              nginx:1.21
