# SSO Configuration

Kosli supports Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with popular identity providers (IdPs) such as Microsoft Entra ID and Okta. This allows users to authenticate using their existing organizational credentials, enhancing security and simplifying access management.

Secrets such as Client Secrets must be shared securely with Kosli to complete the SSO setup. See [Sharing Secrets Securely]({{< relref "sharing_secrets_securely" >}}) for recommended methods.
