## Synopsis

Report Snyk vulnerability scan evidence for a commit in Kosli flows.    
The --scan-results .json file is parsed and uploaded to Kosli's evidence vault.

In CLI <v2.8.2, Snyk results could only be in the Snyk JSON output format. "snyk code test" results were not supported by 
this command and could be reported as generic evidence.

Starting from v2.8.2, the Snyk results can be in Snyk JSON or SARIF output format for "snyk container test". 
"snyk code test" is now supported but only in the SARIF format.

If no vulnerabilities are detected the evidence is reported as compliant. Otherwise the evidence is reported as non-compliant.

kosli report evidence commit snyk [flags]
